### Description
Project 2 explores Spotify data for 150,000+ songs released from 1921 - 2020.  Visualizations have been created to explore the dataset and answer questions such as:
* Which artists have been popular through the decades?
* Which artists have released the highest number of songs?
* What are the most popular songs in each decade?
* Which song characteristics impact popularity?
* What are the song characteristics typically used by each artist?

### Coding Approach

* Visualizations developed with:
* JavaScript
* Chart.js 
* D3.js 
* Website built using HTML / CSS
* Python Flask Restful API
