    <dl class="row">
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Valence</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Acousticness</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Danceability</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Energy</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Explicit</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">Explicit is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a explicit nature of the lyrics of the song. A value of 1.0 is very explicit and 0.0 is not explicit..</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Liveness</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Loudness</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Popularity</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">Popularity is a measure from 0 to 100 and represents that song's popularity rank in the year of its release.</dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-3">Tempo</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">The normalized overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.</dd>
